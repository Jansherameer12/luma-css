# Luma CSS

Luma CSS is a lightweight utility-first CSS framework. It provides simple classes for layout, spacing, typography, buttons, cards, forms, and more — all designed with modern CSS variables and smooth transitions.

## Features

- Base typography and color variables
- Container for responsive layouts
- Buttons with hover and focus effects
- Cards with shadows and gradient backgrounds
- Flexbox utilities for easy alignment
- Spacing utilities (margin and padding)
- Responsive typography
- Styled input fields and textareas

## Usage

### CDN

Include the CSS directly in your HTML via CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jansherameer12/luma-css@v1.0.2/luma.css" />
````

Then apply classes to your elements, for example:

```html
<div class="text-center m-1">Hello, Luma CSS!</div>
<button class="btn">Click Me</button>
<div class="card p-3">Card content</div>
```

### NPM

You can also install via npm:

```bash
npm install luma-css
```

Then import it into your project:

```css
@import 'luma-css/luma.css';
```

## Documentation

See the CSS file for available classes and utilities. The framework uses CSS variables for easy customization.
